                            Late Shree C. K. Pithawala had been the driving force for the setting up of the Navyug
                            Vidyabhavan Trust and continuously drawing inspiration from him.

                            We proudly take note of his multipronged educational and social services rendered selflessly
                            and
                            in the sprint of education. This institute of learning in particular, like many others, owes
                            a
                            great deal to his vision, understanding and missionary zeal right from its inception to its
                            blossoming. This trust has been the fruition of his marathon efforts and huge financial aid
                            without which this dream would have remained unrealized. His contributions in various
                            spheres of
                            Education, Sports, Relief, Culture, Health and Religion have been significant and
                            praiseworthy.

                            Mr. C. K. Pithawallaâ€™s benevolence, charity and philanthropic nature, simple humanity and
                            unassuming personality can be conspicuously seen in many charitable and humanitarion tasks
                            he
                            has carried out, so successfully hugely benefitting the people at large. These would have
                            surely
                            remaind unaccomplished without the exalted use of wealth at his disposal and spirit of
                            selfless
                            service.

                            His doing "Karma" without expecting any return or material reward or seeking fame out of
                            generous contributions in the noble and laudable cause of education is summed up in the
                            message
                            of the "Gita" which he has well imbibed. In a true Gandhian sense he is a "Trustee" or a
                            "Keeper" of possession which he has been using for the benefit of the society. In that he is
                            a
                            true votary of Gandhian ideals and values of life.
