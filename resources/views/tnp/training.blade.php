                            knowledge and skills they have acquired during their academic studies in a real work
                            environment.</li>

                            their technical, professional, and interpersonal skills. They can learn new techniques,
                            tools, and methodologies relevant to their field of study, and acquire valuable
                            industry-specific skills.</li>
